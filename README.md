# LifeLane
LifeLane leverages data science techniques to streamline the location and staffing of emergency medical system (EMS) dispatch sites with the goal of lowering response time and improving fast access to medical care in urban settings. We leverage NYC-OpenData's resources to draw insights that influence policy decisions.
